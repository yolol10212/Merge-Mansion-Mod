This is a fun little project i decided to make to pass the time. it doesnt do anything but i like to pass the time by doing something like this. school is stressful and its a little bit less stressful when im making small lines of code. i hope it can inspire you 
to learn code, and be able to pass time like i do. This is Licensed with the MIT License under 2021 yolol10212.
